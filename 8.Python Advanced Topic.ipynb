    "# Functional Programming in Python\n",
    "Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style. It is a declarative type of programming style. Its main focus is on “what to solve” in contrast to an imperative style where the main focus is “how to solve“. It uses expressions instead of statements. An expression is evaluated to produce a value whereas a statement is executed to assign variables.Concepts of Functional Programming\n",
    "Any Functional programming language is expected to follow these concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pure Functions: \n",
    "These functions have two main properties. First, they always produce the same output for the same arguments irrespective of anything else. Secondly, they have no side-effects i.e. they do modify any argument or global variables or output something.\n",
    "Recursion: There are no “for” or “while” loop in functional languages. Iteration in functional languages is implemented through recursion.\n",
    "Functions are First-Class and can be Higher-Order: First-class functions are treated as first-class variable. The first-class variables can be passed to functions as a parameter, can be returned from functions or stored in data structures.\n",
    "Variables are Immutable: In functional programming, we can’t modify a variable after it’s been initialized. We can create new variables – but we can’t modify existing variables."

    "During functional programming, there is no concept of for loop or while loop, instead recursion is used. Recursion is a process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly. In the recursive program, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution to the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems. A question may arise what is base case? The base case can be considered as a condition that tells the compiler or interpreter to exit from the function."

    "Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while the other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. The server forms the listener socket while the client reaches out to the server. \n",

    "Socket programming is started by importing the socket library and making a simple socket. \n",
